# Scream Jam 2025 Design Doc

## Gameplay Loop
Top-down twin stick shooter styled after Alien Shooter 2's survival mode where you fight increasingly difficult waves of enemies until you lose

Each wave will have a set amount of enemies it will spawn. Killing all the enemies in a wave will complete the wave.

getting weapon improvements over time would be nice, but may be out of scope for the jam

## Aesthetic
The player is a catgirl of some sort, while the enemies should be grotesque monsters. The game will use 3D models for the player and enemies and gibs.

Enemies should blow apart into rigidbody chunks that disappear after a short time, ideally with blood decals that permanently remain on the floor such that the ground becomes ever more red the longer the player survives
